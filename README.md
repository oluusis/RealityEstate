Description

My final school project was an ASP.NET-based real estate website designed to connect buyers and sellers in a dynamic and interactive way. 
Users can explore a variety of real estate offers, with the ability to react to listings they find interesting, making it easier to gauge popularity and demand. T
he site allows sellers to post their properties, including key details like the number of floors, square footage, and other attributes. 
The underlying database employs a many-to-many (m:n) relationship to handle the complex associations between users, offers, and property attributes. Additionally, 
there's an admin section where authenticated administrators can manage all users, oversee demands and offers, and adjust system parameters as needed. This comprehensive approach ensures smooth operation and a great user experience.
